# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview: 

Pewlett-Hackard is on the cusp of a significant wave of retirements across the company as the Baby Boomers reach retirement age. This analysis presents data on how many retirements are coming, from what positions people are retiring, and presents some options to best deal with the increase in retirements. 

## Results: 

The following results summarizes the data collected as part of this analysis:

- There are 72,458 retirements upcoming
- Approximately 70% of the retirements are from senior-level positions
- Only two managers are in the retirement cohort
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentor program

## Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

The first year of retirements will see approximately 8,500 retirements. Each following year will have between 9,200 and 9,400 retirements per year based on current retirement-eligible employees born each year from 1952-1955. Accordingly, as many roles will need to be filled each year during the first wave.

You can see from the tables below how this impacts each department each year:

From these additional tables, it is evident that Development and Production will bear the largest share of the burden, with Sales following closely behind.

#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

As shown in the table of mentor-eligible employees by department, the ratio of retirees to mentors is extremely high.

Pewlett-Hackard does not currently have enough mentors to be able to successful mentor and develop the next generation of employees. The best solution to mitigate the mentor shortage and reduce the retiree-mentor ratio would be to increase the mentor-eligible group to include a broader age range of qualified, retirement-ready employees.
